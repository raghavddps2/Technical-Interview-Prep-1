# `Dutch National Flag Problem`

## `Approach 1: `
    1. I simply counted the occurence of each number and then replaced array values with the count of each integer i got in my dictionary.

    2. Time complexity: O(N)
    3. Space Complexity: O(1)
    4. Data Structure Used: Dictionaty,Array

## `Approach 2`:
    1. The exact implementation details for sorting the entire array is explained in the code.

    2. On a high level, all we do is to keep track of 3 pointers, low,mid and high, and then swap required nodes and moving the pointers.

    3. Time complexity: O(n)
    4. Space Complexity: O(1)
    5. Data Structures: Arrays.
